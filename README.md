## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In this project i felt much more confident with centering elements using Grid. 



### Continued development

I feel the need to keep focusing on responsivness as i am still struggling to understand what element do i need to chenge in the @media and to what values.
